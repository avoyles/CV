\begin{rSubsection}{Nuclear Data for Microcalorimetry}{\textnormal{NNSA Office of International Nuclear Safeguards (NA-241)}}{Co-PI}{FY24--FY25}
\item    Three years at \$1,471,000/year.
\item The goal of this work is to re-determine key gamma-ray emission probabilities for Pu, Am, and U in the 50-208 keV energy range in order for microcalorimeter gamma spectroscopy to reach uncertainty limits in analysis of safeguards samples. 
\item We will design and conduct experimental campaigns using complementary detection methods and advanced sample preparation to measure this data.
